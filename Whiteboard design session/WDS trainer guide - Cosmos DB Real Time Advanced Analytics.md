# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**\*Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!\*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

## Abstract and learning objectives

\[insert what is trying to be solved for by using this workshop. . . \]

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Woodgrove Bank, who provides payment processing services for commerce, is looking to design and implement a PoC of an innovative fraud detection solution. They know from experience and through contacts in the financial industry that there is a constant arms race between fraudsters and banks. Thanks to increasingly powerful and easily accessible technology, financial crime is on the rise. Payment processing companies, like Woodgrove Bank, and their merchant customers risk financial losses due to fraud. They also risk fines from failing to detect or even prevent criminal acts like money laundering or terror financing. In addition, other forms of fraud are on the rise, like ATM fraud, card transaction fraud, payment fraud, and more. In the most basic terms, online fraud is committed when an unauthorized user impersonates another user by taking over their account, using malware, or hijacking internet sessions. When dealing with millions of transactions, it is both crucial and challenging to detect and monitor fraud in real-time across all transactions. Doing so helps prevent additional losses and detect widespread attacks.

Another motive for rapidly prototyping a real-time fraud detection system is that Woodgrove forecasts reaching over USD \$10 Billion in assets, placing them within the stricter regulatory purview of institutions classified by the US government as "big banks". This means that they will be subject to regulatory fines over and above the fraud loss, putting their business at greater risk. Their hope is that building a prototype will help them de-risk certain aspects of the solution they are unsure about, such as whether their streaming data can be processed rapidly enough for real-time detection. They also want to ensure that their historical data is sufficient for training a solid machine learning model and that they have a path forward to constantly retrain and redeploy the model for optimal performance. Finally, they would like to balance reducing false positives with increasing the detection of real fraud. The biggest issue with false positives is that it negatively impacts customer satisfaction. The customer's account could be suspended during investigation, including any pending transactions.

With these challenges in mind, Woodgrove Bank wants to use AI to break the tradeoff between false positive and false negative errors. They hope a well-trained model will also reduce the chance of missing true positives, and do so in a way that is highly performant and globally available. Woodgrove's vision is to offer this capability in the form of new services to their merchant customers. As stated before, their customers are located around the world, and the right solutions for them would minimize any latencies experienced using their service by distributing as much of the solution as possible, as closely as possible, to the regions in which their customers use the service.

> **TODO: Add information on how they will use pre-scored "known" fraud data in conjunction with real-time fraud scoring.**

### Customer needs

1.  Need to provide fraud detection services to our merchant customers, using incoming real-time payment transaction data to provide early warning of fraudulent activity.

2.  We need guidance on how to choose the right ML algorithm, periodically retrain our model, and redeploy the best version of the retrained model for real-time scoring on our web applications.

3.  We would like to schedule batch scoring using our trained model, and make that data globally available in regions closest to our customers through our web applications.

4.  Need to be able to store data from streaming sources into long-term storage, without interfering with jobs reading the data set.

5.  We would like to use a standard platform that supports our near-term data pipeline needs while providing a long-term standard for data science, data engineering, and development.

6.  Need to be able to have a top-level view of fraud trends across the globe.

### Customer objections

1.  We've found it challenging in the past to deal with both streaming data and long-term storage in a unified way, making it difficult to do both inserts and updates to logical tables, having to manually maintain separate transaction logs. Over time, queries became slower because of having so many small files. How do we address these issues?

2.  We are worried about storing secrets, like connection strings, within a notebook anyone can access. We want a centralized way to store these secrets that are accessible across services to cut down on redundancy.

3.  Properly selecting the right algorithm and training a model using the optimal set of parameters can take a lot of time. Is there a way to speed up this process?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1.  Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2.  What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

_High-level architecture_

1.  Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for payment fraud detection, including stream capture and processing, long-term storage, model training, global distribution of the model for real-time scoring and of the pre-scored fraud data, and dashboards.

_Globally distributed data_

1.  Which data storage service would you recommend using that can minimize access latency to globally distributed data? Be specific about how data is replicated.

2.  How does your chosen service handle scaling to meet varying levels of demand across different regions?

_Data ingest_

1.  What are your recommended options for ingesting streaming payment transaction events in a scalable way that can be easily processed while maintaining event order with no data loss?

2.  Given the technical and business requirements at hand, is it best to narrow your options to one platform, or would you combine services for ingesting streaming data?

_Data pipeline processing_

1.  Woodgrove Bank indicated that they would like a unified way to process both streaming data and batch data on a platform that can also support their data science, data engineering, and development needs. Which platform would you recommend, and why?

2.  They are also concerned about difficulties they have had in the past with performing both inserts and updates to long-term storage while processing streaming and batch data. How will your chosen platform cope with this challenge while optimizing file storage, avoiding the degradation in query performance due to many small files?

3.  How will your chosen data processing platform connect to and process data from your chosen data ingest solution for streaming data?

4.  The customer is concerned about being able to protect secrets, like service account keys and connection strings. How do you propose storing and providing access to these secrets within the selected data pipeline processing platform?

_Long-term data storage_

1.  As streaming data is processed, refined, and scored, all of the transactions need to be persisted to long-term storage for analysis, model training and validation, and reporting. This storage needs to handle long-term growth, be fast enough to rapidly ingest new data while simultaneously handling reads against the same data set without interference, and act as a reliable data source for dashboards and reports. Which is your recommended long-term data storage solution, keeping in mind its role within your selected data pipeline processing platform?

2.  How do you ensure your data is continuously optimized within your chosen long-term data storage solution, given the requirements to store inserts and updates while avoiding generating very small, un-optimized files?

3.  Woodgrove Bank wants to retain all raw data (bronze), then parse that data into query tables (silver) which can be joined with dimension tables, such as account information. They also would like to have summary tables (gold) containing business-level aggregates used for their dashboards and reports. How would you support these requirements in your long-term storage solution?

_Model training and deployment_

1.  Describe how your chosen data processing platform will support machine learning model training and deployment. The model will need to be trained on and validated against historical payment transaction data that includes known fraudulent transactions.

2.  What are some processes that can be put in place to support a collaborative approach to producing and deploying the model?

3.  How do you propose deploying the trained model in a way that is scalable, globally accessible, and supports redeploying new versions of the model with little to no downtime? Can these steps be performed within the same data processing platform in which the model is re-trained? How will you support model versioning?

4.  How will you address Woodgrove Bank's desire to simplify the process of running and tracking model experiments through hyperparameter tuning, and selecting the best model based on those experiments?

5.  How will you schedule regular batch scoring of fraud data using the trained model, and make that data available to Woodgrove Bank's web applications at a global scale?

_Dashboards and reporting_

1.  Woodgrove Bank's business analysts would like to have a set of dashboards they can monitor that provide real-time views of fraud trends at a global scale. Thinking back to how your proposed solution provides a set of summary (gold) tables containing business-level aggregates, what do you propose using to meet this requirement? Be specific about how this solution will be put in place and which features it supports.

2.  How do you propose giving access to this same data to Woodgrove Bank's data scientists and data engineers within the data processing environment wherein they can craft complex queries and data visualizations?

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

## Wrap-up

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
