# Cosmos DB real-time advanced analytics hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

Woodgrove Bank, who provides payment processing services for commerce, is looking to design and implement a PoC of an innovative fraud detection solution. They want to provide new services to their merchant customers, helping them save costs by applying machine learning and advanced analytics to detect fraudulent transactions. Their customers are around the world, and the right solutions for them would minimize any latencies experienced using their service by distributing as much of the solution as possible, as closely as possible, to the regions in which their customers use the service.

In this hands-on lab session, you will implement a PoC of the data pipeline that could support the needs of Woodgrove Bank.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions that leverage the strengths of Cosmos DB in support of advanced analytics solutions that require high throughput ingest, low latency serving and global scale in combination with scalable machine learning, big data and real-time processing capabilities.

## Overview

Woodgrove Bank, who provides payment processing services for commerce, is looking to design and implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) of an innovative fraud detection solution. They want to provide new services to their merchant customers, helping them save costs by applying machine learning and advanced analytics to detect fraudulent transactions. Their customers are around the world, and the right solutions for them would minimize any latencies experienced using their service by distributing as much of the solution as possible, as closely as possible, to the regions in which their customers use the service.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![Preferred solution diagram outlining the ingestion of streaming payment transactions into Cosmos DB, and fed into Azure Databricks. Azure Databricks will process the data and insert it into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for long-term storage. Databricks is also used for training machine learning models for batch and real-time fraud detection. Power BI is used for dashboards and reporting.](../media/outline-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

 The solution begins with the payment transaction systems writing transactions to Azure Cosmos DB. With change feed enabled in Cosmos DB, the transactions can be read as a stream of incoming data within an Azure Databricks notebook, using the `azure-cosmosdb-spark` connector, and stored long-term within an Azure Databricks Delta table backed by Azure Data Lake Storage. The Delta tables efficiently manage inserts and updates (e.g., upserts) to the transaction data. Tables created in Databricks over this data can be accessed by business analysts using dashboards and reports in Power BI, by using Power BI's Spark connector. Data scientists and engineers can create their own reports against this data, using Azure Databricks notebooks. Azure Databricks also supports training and validating the machine learning model, using historical data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage. The model can be periodically re-trained using the data stored in Delta tables or other historical tables. The Azure Machine Learning service is used to deploy the trained model as a real-time scoring web service running on a highly available Azure Kubernetes Service cluster (AKS cluster). The trained model is also used in scheduled offline scoring through Databricks jobs, and the "suspicious activity" output is stored in Azure Cosmos DB so it is globally available in regions closest to Woodgrove Bank's customers through their web applications. Finally, Azure Key Vault is used to securely store secrets, such as account keys and connection strings, and serves as a backing for Azure Databricks secret scopes.

> **Note**: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

## Exercise 2: Understanding and preparing the transaction data at scale

Duration: X minutes

In this exercise, you will use Azure Databricks to explore the transaction data stored in Cosmos DB and respond to transactions directly from the Cosmos DB Change Feed. You will also mount Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) in Databricks, and write the incoming streaming transaction data into Azure Databricks Delta tables stored in your data lake.

### Task 1: Create a service principal for OAuth access to the ADLS Gen2 filesystem

Mounting an ADLS Gen2 filesystem using Databricks requires that you use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. In this task, you will create an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) known as a service principal to facilitate the use of OAuth authentication.

> **IMPORTANT**: You must have permissions within your Azure subscription to create an App registration and service principal within Azure Active Directory to complete this task.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand navigation menu, select **App registrations**, and then select **+ New application registration**.

    ![Register new app in Azure Active Directory](media/aad-app-registration.png "Register new app in Azure Active Directory")

2. On the Create blade, enter the following:

    - **Name**: Enter a unique name, such as woodgrove-sp (this name must be unique, as indicated by a green check mark).
    - **Application type**: Select Web app / API.
    - **Sign-on URL**: Enter <https://woodgrove.com>.

    ![Create a new app registration](media/aad-app-create.png "Create a new app registration")

3. Select **Create**.

4. To access your ADLS Gen2 account from Azure Databricks you will need to provide the credentials of your newly created service principal within Databricks. On the Registered app blade that appears, copy the **Application ID** and paste it into a text editor, such as Notepad, for use in the Databricks notebook in an upcoming task.

   ![Copy the Registered App Application ID](media/registered-app-id.png "Copy the Registered App Application ID")

5. Next, select **Settings** on the Registered app blade, and then select **Keys**.

   ![Open Keys blade for the Registered App](media/registered-app-settings-keys.png "Open Keys blade for the Registered App")

6. On the Keys blade, you will create a new password by doing the following under Passwords:

    - **Description**: Enter a description, such as Databricks-ADLS.
    - **Expires**: Select a duration, such as **In 1 year**.

    ![Create new password](media/registered-app-create-key.png "Create new password")

7. Select **Save**, and then copy the key displayed under **Value**, and paste it into a text editor, such as Notepad, for use in the Databricks notebook in an upcoming task. **Note**: This value will not be accessible once you navigate away from this screen, so make sure you copy it before leaving the Keys blade.

    ![Copy key value](media/registered-app-key-value.png "Copy key value")

### Task 2: Grant ADLS Gen2 permissions to the service principal

In this task, you will assign the required permissions to the service principal in your ADLS Gen2 account.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the ADLS Gen2 account you created above, select **Access control (IAM)** from the left-hand menu, and then select **+ Add role assignment**.

   ![ADLS Gen2 Access Control blade](media/access-control.png "ADLS Gen2 Access Control blade")

2. On the Add role assignment blade, set the following:

    - **Role**: Select **Storage Blob Data Contributor (Preview)** from the list.
    - **Assign access to**: Choose **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**.
    - **Select**: Enter the name of the service principal you created above, and then select it from the list.
  
    ![ADLS Gen2 Add role assignment](media/add-role-assignment.png "ADLS Gen2 Add role assignment")

3. Select **Save**

4. You will now see the service principal listed under **Role assignments** on the Access control (IAM) blade.

### Task 3: Retrieve your Azure AD tenant ID

To perform authentication using the service principal account in Databricks you will also need to provide your Azure AD Tenant ID.

1. To retrieve your tenant ID, select **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand navigation menu in the Azure portal, then select **Properties**, and select the copy button next to **Directory ID** on the Directory Properties blade.

   ![Azure Active Directory is selected in the left-hand menu on the Azure portal, and the properties menu is selected. The Directory ID field is highlighted.](media/aad-tenant-id.png "Retrieve Tenant ID")

2. Paste the copied value into a text editor, such as Notepad, for use in the Databricks notebook in an upcoming task.

### Task 4: Install the Azure Cosmos DB Spark Connector in Databricks

In this task, you will install the [Azure Cosmos DB Spark Connector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmosdb-spark) on your Databricks cluster.
